The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It's a form of polyalphabetic substitution, meaning it uses multiple substitution alphabets. The keyword is repeated to match the length of the plaintext, and each letter in the keyword determines the shift value for the corresponding letter in the plaintext.
