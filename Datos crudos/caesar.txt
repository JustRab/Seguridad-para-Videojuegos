The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This makes it a type of substitution cipher, specifically a monoalphabetic substitution, where each letter is consistently replaced by another.
